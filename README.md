{
  &quot;<span style='color:blue'><b>name</b></span>&quot;: &quot;<span style='color:green'>example</span>&quot;,

## Configuration

`fetch` can be configured using a file with an ini-like format. Configuration files support both global settings and host-specific configurations.

### File Locations

`fetch` searches for configuration files in the following order:

- the file location specified with the `-c` or `--config` flag
- on Windows at `%AppData%\fetch\config`
- on Unix-like systems at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fetch/config` or `$HOME/.config/fetch/config`

### Configuration Precedence

Settings are applied in the following order of precedence:

- CLI flags (highest priority)
- domain-specific configuration
- global configuration
- default values (lowest priority)

### Basic Example

```ini
# Global settings
color = on
format = on
timeout = 30

# Domain-specific settings
[api.example.com]
header = X-API-Key: your-api-key
timeout = 10
```

For complete configuration documentation including all available options, file format details, and advanced examples, see [CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).
